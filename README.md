# Fibonacci-Sequence
A Simple School Project on the Fibonacci Sequence

The project is really simple.
With the help of python, This project want to show some graphs related to the fibonacci sequence.

It has 2 major brances, the true fibonacci and the squared fibonacci.

The true fibonacci branch is a branch where it is all related to this equation:
### $F(n) =  F(n-1) + F(n-2)$

The squared fibonacci is related to this equation:
### $F^2 (n) = F(n) * F(n+1)$
