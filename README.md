# Fibonacci-Sequence
A Simple School Project on the Fibonacci Sequence

## All the code involved is in the fibonacci module (module_fibonacci.py) for anyone interested.

The project is really simple.
With the help of python, This project want to show some graphs related to the fibonacci sequence.

It has 2 major brances, the true fibonacci and the squared fibonacci.

The ***fibonacci Sequence*** branch is a branch where it is all related to this equation:
### $F(n) =  F(n-1) + F(n-2)$

The ***Squared fibonacci*** is related to this equation:
### $F^2 (n) = F(n) * F(n+1)$
